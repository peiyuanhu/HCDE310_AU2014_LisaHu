#Exercise 1 (working with lst):
#a.	Print the first element of lst
print lst[0]
#b.	Print the fourth element of lst
print lst[3]
#c.	Print the first three elements of lst
print lst[:3]
#d.	Print the last element of lst
print lst[-1]
#e.	Print the number of items in lst
print len(lst)
#Exercise 2 (working with s):
#a.	Print the first three characters of s
print s[:3]
#b.	Print the substring "hcde310" from s
print s[11:18]
#c.	Print the contents of s starting from the 9th character
print s[8:]
#d.	Print the last five letters of s
print s[len(s)-5 :]
#e.	Print the number of characters in s
print len(s)
