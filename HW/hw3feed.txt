from: Wei Kong
post: Sorry if this was answered before, I couldn't find it below.  When I open mint, it says that I'm "Running in software rendering mode" and it's running without hardware acceleration, which uses more CPU. Anyway to fix?  My system runs ok as is, so it's not really a big deal, but it'd be awesome if it gets better.

comment: Cool thanks.. So, this is completely separate from the VMware Workstation correct?
from: Perry Lin Meas
comment: Ahh I don't exactly know and I forgot that some people are using Workstation. In that case, you might have to ask Sean
from: Wei Kong
comment: No worries, thanks for your help anyway! At least you gave me an alternate route to go if I can't find a solution for Workstation. :)
from: Sean Munson
comment: The link Perry posted works on VirtualBox. It won't work on VMWare (Fusion or Workstation), where the VMWare drivers aren't quite caught up with what Mint is using.  So it depends on what you're running.   If you're on Windows and Workstation is slow, the best thing seems to be disabling debug mode (see earlier post about this).  An alternative is installing VirtualBox and the guest addition.  If you're on OS X, Fusion is the way to go, though could also try VirtualBox + guest additions on OS X.
from: Wei Kong
comment: Ok cool. I've disabled debug mode already, and it works well enough. I was just wondering if I could get it snappier. I'll probably check out VirtualBox after this next assignment is done.

comment: I *think* something your SVN repository is corrupted in some way, but I'm not sure how. It's probably easiest to replace it by running the following commands in Terminal:  cd ~/System rm -r hcde310a14 svn checkout https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/hcde310a14/ cd ~ ./getHW.sh  ./getHW.sh 1  (the first getHW.sh is necessary to get the lecture files back, the second should get hw1)

from: Xiaochen Yu
comment: oh that location is where hw1 is
from: Chia-Fang Chung
comment: Hi, you can try to restart Eclipse, sometimes it doesn't read the metadata correctly and restart might help.  The other thing is to check whether those files are still in your file system, such as your Homework should be in /home/me/Homeworks, lectures should be in home/me/System/hcde310a14/lectures, and solutions should be in home/me/System/hcde310a14/solutions.  If they are still there, we can try to import them back. (Right click on the package explorer -> import -> Existing project into workspace). I can also help with that if you can drop by my office (423D) sometime tomorrow. Let me know if you plan to come so I won't leave my desk though.

post: Ok, I've been having some major computer issues (laptop died, sharing another comp with someone for now) so I'm way behind with all this HW0/setting up virtual environment stuff. Finally got VMware downloaded and the USB stick yesterday, but VMWare keeps telling me "Error while powering on: the file specified is not a virtual disk." Is this because my disk file is corrupt? I'm attempting to re-download the disk image atm but since it's taking a while, has anyone else encountered this issue and found the problem to be something else? Thanks!
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi Nicole - how are you opening VMWare and the file? That might help us troubleshoot.
from: Nicole Tilly
comment: Thanks for the quick response! I have VMWare Player open and I click on "Open a virtual machine." From there, I open my unzipped folder hcde310a14 and there is one file available to click on: hcde310a14.vmx. I click on that and it looks like VMware at least recognizes that I'm trying to use Linux (image attached). But then when I press play it gives me the error message I wrote about above.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Hi - I *think* you've been affected by some Windows VMWare incompatibility. If you download VMWare Workstation 11 (https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/workstation/vmware-workstation-technology-preview-2014 and the license key is M50AC-J034J-08L8A-03ARM-3D14A), and then open the image using that, I think it will work for you.

Thanks to Korn and Mia for helping us catch this problem early.

Download Workstation 11 (the technology preview) from https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/workstation/vmware-workstation-technology-preview-2014  This should be freely available until January 2015, at which point it will go in the store and you can get a "free" license for a year.

comment: SUCCESS on Windows 7 64-bit! It runs VERY slow (so slow you can't see what you type), but it technically works. The trick is to (1) clicks Ok to everything Windows warns about and (2) wait until you see a desktop before doing anything (takes ~4 minutes for me).  Step-by-step of my process if anyone needs it:  Used the non-zipped version of the class files (waited for it in class) so did not have to unzip.  Had to register for a free VMWare account.  Used the physical address for the HCDE department as my company (mandatory) taken from http://www.hcde.washington.edu/contact-us  3960 Benton Lane NE University of Washington Seattle, WA 98195   Downloaded the File where Information says "Vmware Workstation Technical Preview July 2014 for Windows Product installation including VMware Tools for Windows Operating Systems."  Took ~10 minutes to download.  Installed.  Had to uninstall the VMWare player I installed while in class.  Installer asked 3 times if I wanted to allow installation. Said yes every time.  Asked me to enter Installation Key. Said Skip.  Installation took ~5 minutes.  Started the VMPlayer.  Loaded and played the virtual machine (.vmdk file) into the player.  Alert popped up: "Binary translation is incompatible with long mode on this platform. Long mode will be disabled in this virtual environment and applications requiring long mode will not function properly as a result. See http://vmware.com/info?id=152 for more details."  I clicked Ok.  Alert popped up: "You are running this virtual machine with debugging enabled. Debugging performs extra error checking to help diagnose problems, but it also lowers performance."  I clicked Ok.  Alert popped up: "This virtual machine might have been moved or copied. In order to configure certain management and networking features, VMware Player needs to know if this virtual machine was moved or copied. If you don't know, answer "I Copied It"."  I clicked "I copied it".  Windows only shows a green graphics in the middle.   I clicked ALT-TAB and discovered there were 2 windows open on top of each other (maybe it opens 2 windows always...).  It took ~2 minutes to load.  Finally, I landed n a graphical login screen (similar to a Windows login screen, not the text login).  I entered my name.   It prompted me to enter a password but I switched windows to type this documentation. When I returned, it had logged me into a desktop. Maybe typing in my text editor program also typed it into VMWare? Oops.  Inside the desktop, it runs too slow to use.  At the top of the VMPlayer, is a icon that looks like a "Pause" symbol. Clicked that and under, clicked "Restart Guest".  Again, only agreen icon appeared. I clicked ALT-TAB to see Linux Mint starting.  ~5 minutes later, back in the desktop without having to login this time.  Opened Terminal.  Entered Python program successfully.  It runs annoyingly slow but works.

comment: The VM is set up to auto-login after a few seconds, but the username is "me" and password is "hcde310"  Turning off debug mode might improve the performance; there's a thread on VMWare's site: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/484066
from: Justin Woodum
comment: I found directions that worked on a link I found via the link above: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/448058 (again, my computer has a 64-bit processor so files were in a "x64" folder. Startup time is about the same but the desktop and terminal run much faster. This will work. Thanks!  Here's what I did:  Rename C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-vmx-debug.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-vmx-debug.exe_ORIGINAL  Rename C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\vmware-remotemks-debug.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\vmware-remotemks-debug.exe_ORIGINAL  Copy and rename C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-vmx.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-vmx-debug.exe  Copy and rename C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-remotemks.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player\x64\vmware-remotemks-debug.exe

comment: Fail. The version of the VMware I downloaded above prompted me for a license or to use a 30 day trial. Since our class will last longer than 30 days, that won't help. My current plan is to install my own web server and Python instances, rather than keep working with VMware.

comment: Oi....except that I need Linux running probably?
from: Justin Woodum
comment: Maybe I will subscribe to Digital Ocean or Linode, use their pre-made images to install Linux and then install Python, if necessary.
from: Sean Munson
comment: Linux isn't necessary. We use the virtual machine because we've had horrible problems in past years with students running different Python versions with different installs.  If you are using workstation 11, the download page has a license key good through January 2015.  If you go the non VMware route, the main things are to stick with Python 2.7.x (anything in 2.7 should be fine, we use 2.7.4 when we write sample code, write homeworkers, and grade homeworks). You'll also simplify your life greatly if you install eclipse (or another IDE) that will sync with an SVN repository.
from: Justin Woodum
comment: Had already uninstalled the VMware requiring the key. Re-installed and used key successfully. I assume this can be used with an already existing installation, too. For reference, key is M50AC-J034J-08L8A-03ARM-3D14A (expires January 15, 2015). Working now.

comment: That's fine - you'll also want to set up SVN to check out the homework and lecture code (you can download the files directly, but SVN is easier in the long run), and try to stay with python 2.7 (otherwise some of the examples / assignments may fail or behave differently)
